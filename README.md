# CityMapper
## Overview

Citymapper is a Python-based software developed for an academic assignment. The application is designed to suggest travel routes between two transit stations.
### Features

    Travel Time Estimation: Provides average travel time for suggested routes.
    Mode Selection: Allows users to choose among different modes of transportation, including RER (regional express train), bus, tram, and walking.
    Map Interaction: Enables users to click on a location on the map to find the nearest station.
    Route Mapping: Visualizes the travel route on the map.

### Technical Aspects
Database Management with PostgreSQL

    - Data Handling: Extensive use of PostgreSQL for creating, deleting, and managing large datasets.
    - Data Conversion: Implemented functionality to convert data between CSV, GeoJSON, and JSON formats to SQL.
    - Database Design: Structured SQL tables adhering to BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form) and 3NF (Third Normal Form) to ensure database normalization and efficient data organization.



### I played a crucial role in the development of this project, contributing significantly to both its graphical interface and technical aspects, from its inception to finalization.
